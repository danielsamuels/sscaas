How do I get started?\r\n\r\nThe first thing you'll need to do is [create an Incoming Webhook](https://slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook) which will allow SSCaaS to post messages into your Slack instance in response to slash commands.\r\n\r\nYou should be given a Webhook URL, keep a hold of this as you'll need it later.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to [add a Slash Command](https://slack.com/services/new/slash-commands).  The URL and setup will vary based on which command you would like to use, see below for the full instructions for each command.\r\n\r\n####Â Dictionary lookup\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n#### Developer Excuses\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n#### Reddit linker\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n#### Site availability checker\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n#### Urban Dictionary lookup\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n### I think you should have X in SSCaaS.\r\nI probably agree! Feel free to open an issue on the project or, even better, a Pull Request!\r\n\r\n### I don't trust you, I want to self-host this.\r\nGo for it!  You should be able to simply `go get` the package and install it without any issues.","google":"UA-62733020-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
